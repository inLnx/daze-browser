                <p class="mb-4">
                    Released in 2021, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 was a significant device, marking Samsung's return to Wear OS. As we navigate through 2025, many wonder if this four-year-old smartwatch still holds its ground against newer, more advanced competitors. This review delves into its performance, features, and overall value, providing insights for potential buyers and current users alike.

                <p>
                    Despite the launch of several newer iterations, including the Galaxy Watch 7, the Watch 4 continues to be a daily driver for many. Its longevity is a testament to its initial design and Samsung's commitment to software support. [1]

                    <p class="text-on-surface-variant mb-3">
                        Remarkably, the Galaxy Watch 4 still runs on the latest version of OneUI for wearables, OneUI 6 Watch, the same as the newer Galaxy Watch 7. Its internals handle the latest Wear OS build smoothly, with only minor lags when launching apps. [1] Samsung's long-term software support is a significant advantage. [1]

                    <p class="text-on-surface-variant mb-3">
                        The Watch 4 offers a robust suite of health features including ECG, blood pressure monitoring, and body composition measurement, mirroring capabilities found in the latest smartwatches. Standard features like heart rate and SpO2 monitoring are also present. [1] The Google Play Store integration allows for third-party apps like Strava and Hevy for workout tracking. [1]

                        The display panel still looks very good, offering a nice and bright viewing experience. [3, 5] Crucially, the Galaxy Watch 4 has become a highly attractive budget option in 2025, costing significantly less than newer models and even the Galaxy Watch FE in the used market. [3, 5] It's a strong contender for an entry-level Galaxy Watch. [3]

                <!-- Card 1: Battery Life -->

                    <p class="text-on-surface-variant mb-3">
                        The most significant drawback of the Galaxy Watch 4 in 2025 is its battery life. Many users report needing to charge it before bed, as it barely lasts an entire day, often only around 12 hours. [1, 4] This makes sleep tracking challenging. Charging speeds are also slow, taking approximately 2 hours to go from 0% to 100%. [5]

                <!-- Card 2: Lacks Modern Features -->
                <div class="bg-surface-container-low p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg">
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/cccccc/ffffff?text=Older+Tech" alt="Older smartwatch technology" class="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-lg mb-4 shadow-sm">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-on-surface">Lacks Newer Innovations</h3>
                    <p class="text-on-surface-variant mb-3">
                        As an older device, the Watch 4 naturally lacks some of the modern advancements found in the Galaxy Watch 5, 6, or 7. This includes features like Galaxy AI, upgraded sensors for better accuracy, sleep apnea detection, and larger batteries that offer multi-day endurance. [1, 3] The stock strap has also been noted to cause irritation for some users. [5]

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-on-surface">Final Verdict: Is the Galaxy Watch 4 Still Worth It in 2025?</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    For those seeking a budget-friendly smartwatch that handles core functions like notifications, calls, and comprehensive health tracking (heart rate, steps, ECG, body composition), the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 remains a surprisingly viable option in 2025. [2, 3, 4, 7, 8] Its continued software support ensures a smooth user experience despite its age. [1]
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    However, the significant compromise is battery life. If all-day usage with sleep tracking is crucial, or if you desire the latest AI features and multi-day battery, investing in a newer model like the Galaxy Watch 5 or 6 might be more suitable. [1, 3, 5] But for its price point, especially on the used market, the Galaxy Watch 4 offers excellent value for a functional and feature-rich smartwatch experience. [3, 4]
